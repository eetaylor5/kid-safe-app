# kid-safe-app

This is the most up-to-date repository.

  The KidSafe app is a mobile app for children ages 5-14. It is designed to help parents feel better about their child's safety, especially while home alone. The parent can input important safety information for various emergency situations, like a fire or severe weather or getting locked out of the house, by clicking the "Parental Control" button on the home screen and selecting an option from the menu. Once the parent has the answered questions, the child will be able to view the given input by clicking on the corresponding button on the home screen. This app is not meant to replace practicing for emergency situations, but it's supposed to help children remember what to do in the moment, if needed.
  
  I developed the app in PyCharm, so it may be necessary to clone it there and download the KivyMD dependencies. To do so:
  - Go to Settings
  - Click on the "Project: kid-safe-app" dropdown
  - Select "Python Interpreter" 
  - Make sure you have Python 3.7 selected
  - Click the plus at the bottom to search and download the following: 
    - Kivy
    - Kivy-Garden
    - kivymd

 Once those have been added, you should be able to just run main.py. Please reach out to me if you have any questions or if it won't run.
